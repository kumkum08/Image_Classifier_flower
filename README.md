# Flower Image Classifier

## Overview

A deep learning model that classifies flower images into different species using a CNN.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
- OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib

## How It Works

The model is trained on a dataset of flower images and learns to identify patterns in different species. It uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract features and make predictions.

## Future Improvements

- Data augmentation
- Web-based interface
- Mobile optimization
